##NPM
`npm init [-f|--force|-y|--yes]` - creates a package.json file | If invoked with flags it will only used defaults and not prompt you for any options

`npm install` - command can be used to install all dependencies


##Babel
- Babel transforms the ES6 JavaScript that we will be writing into ES5 JavaScript that current browsers can understand.
- Babel is particularly important for React developers because of JSX.
    - [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to XML. You can use a simple JSX syntactic transform with React. It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.
